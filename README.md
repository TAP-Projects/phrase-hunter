## Playing the Game
Your goal is to guess all the letters in a hidden, random phrase. At the beginning, you'll only sees the number of letters and words in the phrase, represented by blank boxes on the screen.

Clicks an onscreen keyboard to guess letters in the phrase.After a letter has been guessed, the letter is disabled on the onscreen keyboard and you can't select that letter again.

If the selected letter is in the phrase at least once, the letter and its position in the phrase is highlighted on screen. All instances of the letter are made visible (so if there are 3 A's, all of the A's in the phrase appear at once).

If the selected letter is not in the phrase, you lose one 'heart.' You have 5 hearts.

Keep playing until you reveal the word or phrase or until you've lost all of your heats.
